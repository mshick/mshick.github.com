### Summary

As the VP of Engineering at Parsley Health, I’ve built the early products and the engineering team that has seen the company through a Series A raise with one the most acclaimed VC firms in New York. Prior to Parsley I was a tech lead with Fast Company magazine, where I built tech serving millions of readers per month, and I served as the technical director at a boutique creative agency.

### Work Experience

* **Parsley Health, Vice President of Engineering**  \[2016-Present\]

  As the first engineering hire and manager of the engineering team, I’ve built an engineering team of 9, which includes data science, data, growth and product engineering concerns. I have worked as the technical lead through our Seed and Series A funding rounds. I personally built initial versions of our patient & checkout web applications, our synchronization backend and our general use application API. I am involved in all major technical architecture and strategy decisions.
* **Ronik Design, Technical Director** \[2014-2016\]

  Oversaw the architecture and execution of dozens of client projects, managed interns and other developers. Clients included Purpose, Phaidon, Tycoon, MiMedia, and Chartbeat.

  Toward the end of my tenure I was also involved in the planning and initial development of a homegrown CMS product, TakeShape.
* **Fast Company, Lead Developer** \[2011-2014\]

  At _Fast Company_ we took an overburdened Drupal-based website and brought it into the cloud, leveraging AWS and Apache Solr. We recreated the frontend as a rich client-side application for our millions of monthly uniques and rebuilt the editing interface to support publishing to a network of five sites, with sophisticated scheduling and cross-posting features.
* **Mansueto Ventures, Senior Multimedia Producer \[**2005-2011\]

  Producer of video and podcast content for _Inc._ and _Fast Company_ magazines, before this was commonplace. Made major platform decisions and built a substantial amount of technical tooling and process to handle publishing and presentation of content.
* **Freelance projects**

  Though I don't have much time for this lately, I still manage the website for the Swedish art gallery [Galleri Magnus Karlsson](http://wwww.gallerimagnuskarlsson). Over several years this site has grown to house thousands of works by more than 20 artists, and hundreds of news items and events. I'm happy to say, I very rarely need to do anything to it.

  I was also involved in filming and producing a music documentary, for which I have an [IMDB credit](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3800248/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).
