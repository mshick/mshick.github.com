### Summary

As a web software developer, the bulk of my experience has dealt with content creation and management. I began working in this area developing strategies to manage multimedia content at _Fast Company_ magazine, and progressively worked on broader aspects of the content creator workflow as the lead developer there. I'm constantly evolving my preferred technology stack to solve the variety of problems that come up in client work at the digital agency Ronik Design, and feel one of my core strengths is bending with the wind, approaching technical solutions in a non-dogmatic fashion. I'm very interested in and sensitive to design and aesthetics as well, which makes Ronik's design focus a great fit for me.

### Work experience

* **Ronik Design** [2014-2016]  

  As Technical Director I have overseen the architecture and execution of dozens of client projects, managed interns and other developers, and am constantly evolving the technical solutions we use to make this all happen.
  We've worked with a variety of clients, such as the socially-minded Nonprofit Finance Fund and Purpose, the Phaidon publishing subsidiary Regan Arts, and a host of tech start-ups including Tycoon, MiMedia, and Chartbeat.

* **Fast Company** [2011-2014]  

  While Lead Developer at _Fast Company_ we took an overburdened Drupal-based website and brought it into the cloud, leveraging AWS and Apache Solr. We also built out a client-side Javascript-based web experience for our millions of monthly uniques, long before that was commonplace, optimizing for responsiveness and engagement beyond the first page load. The editor experience was completely overhauled, and enhanced to support publishing to a network of five sites, with sophisticated scheduling features that allowed fluid cross-posting and scheduling throughout all the properties.

* **Mansueto Ventures** [2005-2011]  

  I began working as a production coordinator at Mansueto Ventures (publisher of business magazines _Inc._ and _Fast Company_) with a particular focus on producing podcasts and videos, before YouTube or an iTunes Store existed offering podcasts. Over the years I recorded, produced and handled technical aspects of distributing hundreds of scrappy news and business-interest pieces, including the creation of encoding workflows, and designing and coding players and archives.

* **Freelance projects**  

  Though I don't have much time for this lately, I still manage the website for the Swedish art gallery [Galleri Magnus Karlsson](http://wwww.gallerimagnuskarlsson). Over several years this site has grown to house thousands of works by more than 20 artists, and hundreds of news items and events. I'm happy to say, I very rarely need to do anything to it.  

  I was also involved in filming and producing a music documentary, for which I have an [IMDB credit](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3800248/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).

### Education

* **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** [1999-2003]  
  **Bachelor of Arts with a dual-major in Anthropology and Cultural Studies**  

  This is a fairly non-standard major for a programmer. I hoped to study philosophy with a contemporary bent, and also make films. I was constantly attempting to inject the primitive internet and computer-produced art into my work.

  3.8 GPA.
