An amazing GraphQL content API, modeling UI and static site generator in one. Developed using AWS Lambda, Dynamo, React & Redux.

I was part of the team that began work on this while at [Ronik Design](http://www.ronikdesign.com) in 2016. The project has developed amazingly and I'm working it into a few current projects.
